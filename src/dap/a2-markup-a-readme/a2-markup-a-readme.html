      <div>
         <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <strong>Declarative:</strong> React makes it painless to create
               interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your
               application, and React will efficiently update and render just the
               right components when your data changes. Declarative views make
               your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to
               debug.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Component-Based:</strong> Build encapsulated components
               that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex
               UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of
               templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep
               the state out of the DOM.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Learn Once, Write Anywhere:</strong> We don't make
               assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can
               develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.
               React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile
               apps using <a href="https://reactnative.dev"> React Native</a>.

         <h2>Installation</h2>
         <hr />

         <p>
            React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and
            <strong>you can use as little or as much React as you need:</strong>
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Use
               <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#online-playgrounds">Online Playgrounds</a>
               to get a taste of React
            </li>
            <li>
               Add React to a Website as a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in one
               minute.
            </li>

            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            You can use React as a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag from a
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html">CDN</a>, or as a
            react package on
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react">npm</a>

         <p>
            You can find the React documentation
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/">on the website</a>

         <p>
            Check out the <a href="">Getting Started</a> page for a quick
            overview.
         </p>
         <p>The documentation is divided into several sections:</p>

         <h2>Examples</h2>
         <hr />

         <p>
            We have several examples <a>on the website</a>. Here is the first
            one to get you started:
         </p>
         <code>import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client"; <br />
            function HelloMessage({ name }) {<br />
            return &lt;div&gt;Hello {name}&lt;/div&gt;;<br />
            }<br />
            const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("container"));<br />
            root.render(&lt;HelloMessage name="Taylor" /&gt;);
          </code>
         <p>
            This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the
            page.
         </p>
         <p>
            You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax;
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">we call it JSX</a>. JSX is not required to use
            React, but it makes code more
            readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using
            React as a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>tag, read
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#optional-try-react-with-jsx">this
               section</a>
            on integrating JSX; otherwise, the
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">recommended JavaScript toolchains</a>
            handle it automatically.
         </p>
