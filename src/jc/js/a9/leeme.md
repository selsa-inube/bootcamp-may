# Mail Delivery Robot Project

## Overview

This project involves programming a robot for mail delivery within a virtual village. The robot will navigate through predefined routes using a route graph, implemented in JavaScript. This readme provides an overview of the project structure, modules, dependencies, and relevant details.

## Modules

### Graph Module (`graph.js`)

**Responsibility**: Manages the creation and manipulation of the route graph.

### Routes Module (`routes.js`)

**Responsibility**: Defines and stores the predefined routes between various points in the village.

### Main Module (`main.js`)

**Responsibility**: Integrates the `graph` and `routes` modules to execute the core logic of the mail delivery program.

## Dependencies

- `main.js` depends on `graph.js` and `routes.js`.
- `graph.js` does not depend on any other module.
- `routes.js` does not depend on any other module.

## External Libraries

### npm Packages

- **graphlib**: A robust library for graph manipulation available on npm. It provides tested and optimized functionality, which can streamline development and ensure reliability in our graph operations.

## Getting Started

To start working on the project:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install dependencies using npm:
3. Modify and extend the functionality as required for your specific use case.

## Usage

Describe how to use the project, including any setup instructions or command-line arguments needed to run the main script (`main.js`).
