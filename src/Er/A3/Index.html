          <strong>CULVER CITY, CALIFORNIA</strong>Tonight at the 74th Primetime
          Emmy Awards, the beloved Apple TV+ hit series “Ted Lasso” joined the
          ranks of comedy legends with its win for Outstanding Comedy Series for
          its first and second seasons, becoming only the eighth series in the
          genre in 74 years of Emmy history to do so. The second season of “Ted
          Lasso” also became the most Emmy-winning comedy for the second year in
          a row with four total wins, including Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead
          Actor in a Comedy Series (Jason Sudeikis), Outstanding Supporting
          Actor in a Comedy Series (Brett Goldstein), and Outstanding Directing
          for a Comedy Series (MJ Delaney). Apple’s “Ted Lasso” now joins the
          ranks of only seven other comedy series in history that have landed
          Outstanding Comedy Series wins in their first two years: “Modern
          Family,” “30 Rock,” “Frasier,” “The Golden Girls,” “Cheers,” “All in
          the Family” and “The Phil Silvers Show.” “We’re so grateful and
          humbled to see ‘Ted Lasso’ honored with back-to-back wins for best
          comedy as audiences around the world continue to love the show and
          these characters as much as we do,” said Zack Van Amburg, Apple’s head
          of Worldwide Video. “It has been such an honor for all of us at Apple
          to collaborate with the exceptionally gifted cast and creative team to
          bring this heartwarming, hilarious, and kind series to the screen. We
          sincerely thank the Television Academy for recognizing the show and
          appreciate everyone for believing.” “It is incredibly rewarding to see
          ‘Ted Lasso’ join the ranks of legendary comedies with best comedy wins
          for its first two seasons,” said Jamie Erlicht, Apple’s head of
          Worldwide Video. “We send our warmest congratulations to everyone on
          the cast and crew, and to Jason, Brett, and MJ for their individual
          Emmy Awards. We thank the Television Academy and also our spectacular
          teams who have worked tirelessly to bring this very special series to
          viewers across the globe.” In total, Apple TV+ landed nine Emmy Awards
          this year, including five Creative Arts Emmy Awards with “Carpool
          Karaoke: The Series” earning the top honor for Outstanding Short Form
          Comedy, its fifth win in a row; celebrated Best Drama Series nominee
          “Severance” making its Emmy debut with two wins including Outstanding
          Music Composition for a Series and Outstanding Main Title Design;

          Original Music and Lyrics; and dramatic mystery series “Home Before
          Dark” landing the previously announced juried award for Outstanding
          Motion Design. In addition to this year’s honors for the sophomore
          season of “Ted Lasso,” the first season of the series also made
          history at last year’s 73rd Primetime Emmy Awards as the
          most-nominated freshman comedy series in history, nabbing seven awards
          in total, including Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Lead Actor
          in a Comedy Series (Jason Sudeikis), Outstanding Supporting Actor in a

        <p>
          In “Severance,” Mark Scout (Adam Scott) leads a team at Lumon
          Industries, whose employees have undergone a severance procedure,
          which surgically divides their memories between their work and
          personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is
          called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of an
          unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of
          his work… and of himself.

          Chris Black, John Cameron, and Andrew Colville are executive producers

        <p>
          Jason Sudeikis is Ted Lasso, an American football coach hired to
          manage a British soccer team — despite having no experience. But what
          he lacks in knowledge, he makes up for with optimism, underdog
          determination — and biscuits. The widely acclaimed series also stars
          Hannah Waddingham, Brendan Hunt, Jeremy Swift, Juno Temple, Brett
          Goldstein, Phil Dunster, and Nick Mohammed.
          <br /><br />

          Studio Group. Doozer’s Jeff Ingold also serves as an executive
          producer, with Liza Katzer as co-executive producer. The series was
          developed by Sudeikis, Lawrence, Brendan Hunt, and Joe Kelly, and is
          based on the preexisting format and characters from NBC Sports.
