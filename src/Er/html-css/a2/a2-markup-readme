        <p>
        React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Declarative:</strong>
                React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for
                each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and
                render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views
                make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to
                debug.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Component-Based:</strong> 
                Build encapsulated components that manage their
                own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is
                written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data
                through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Learn Once, Write Anywhere:</strong> We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology
                stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing
                code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps

        <h2>Installation
        </h2><hr>
        <p>React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and you can use as little or as much React as you need:
            <ul>
                <li>Use <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#online-playgrounds">Online Playgrounds</a> 
                    to get a taste of React.</li>

                    as a &lt;script&gt; tag in one minute.</li>

                    if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.</li>
            </ul>
            You can use React as a &lt;script&gt; tag from a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html">CDN</a>, 
            or as a react package on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react">npm.</a>

        <h2>Examples</h2><hr>
            <p>We have several examples <a href="https://reactjs.org/">on the website.</a>
            Here is the first one to get you started:
            </p>
            <div>
                <p>
                import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";<br><br>
                function HelloMessage({ name }) {<br>
                return &lt;div&gt;Hello {name}&lt;/div&gt;;<br>
                }<br><br>
                const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("container"));<br>
                root.render(&lt;HelloMessage name="Taylor" /&gt;);<br>
                </p>
            </div><br>
            <p>This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.<br><br>
            You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">we call it JSX</a>. 
            JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. 
            If you're using React as a &lt;script&gt; tag, read <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#optional-try-react-with-jsx">this section</a> 
            on integrating JSX; otherwise, the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">recommended JavaScript toolchains</a> 
            handle it automatically.
